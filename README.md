### graphmlToNx.py:  creates graph from .graphml file. Like zoo topology [http://www.topology-zoo.org/] of internet sometimes needs to
### be exported as graph or mininet topology. This script returns networkx graph object
##        Usage:
####            Add graphml files under a directory graphml and open graphmlToNx.py  to change the filename at the end of the file
####            GraphmlToNx(inputFile='graphmlfiles/Abilene.graphml')
####            python graphmlToNx.py 
####            nxGraph will hold your graph
